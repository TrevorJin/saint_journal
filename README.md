### Map

Saint Stories tracks the birth and death locations of every saint in its database. With this data, their locations are displayed on a world map and can be filtered by demographics (martyrs, popes, mystics, etc.)

The blog will be the main form of saint discovery for the world. It will bring their stories to the light, all with hard data to back it up.
